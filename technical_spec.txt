Okay, this is an ambitious and cool project! Let's flesh out this prompt into a more detailed plan.

Project Title: NetKVMSwitch (Networked KVM Switch with Streamlit UI)

Core Idea:
A software-based KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) solution allowing a central laptop to display video feeds from, and send keyboard/mouse inputs to, multiple source laptops over a local network. A Streamlit web UI on the central laptop will manage connections and switching.

I. Core Functionality & Architecture:

Central Control Hub (Server - on the "Central Laptop"):

Responsibilities:

Manages connections from source laptops (clients).

Receives video streams from all connected clients.

Receives keyboard/mouse events locally on the central laptop.

Forwards keyboard/mouse events to the currently selected source laptop.

Hosts the Streamlit UI for control and display.

Handles switching logic (which source laptop is "active").

Key Components:

Network Listener: For client discovery and connection requests.

Input Manager: Captures local K/M events (e.g., using pynput or OS-specific APIs).

Video Aggregator/Decoder: Receives and decodes video streams.

Output Forwarder: Sends K/M events to the active client.

State Manager: Keeps track of connected clients, active client, stream status.

Source Laptop Agents (Clients - on "Different Laptops"):

Responsibilities:

Connects to the Central Control Hub.

Captures the screen (video).

Encodes and streams video to the Central Hub.

Receives keyboard/mouse events from the Central Hub.

Injects received K/M events into its own OS.

Key Components:

Network Communicator: Connects to server, sends video, receives K/M.

Screen Capturer: (e.g., using mss, Pillow, OS-specific APIs, or even a lightweight VNC-like capture).

Video Encoder: (e.g., OpenCV with ffmpeg backend, libx264 via Python bindings, or GStreamer) for H.264 or similar.

Input Injector: (e.g., pynput, pyautogui, or OS-specific APIs) to simulate K/M events.

Communication Protocol:

Control Channel (TCP): For reliable transmission of commands, K/M events, connection management, and metadata.

Messages: Client hello, server ack, switch active client, K/M event data, keep-alives, stream status.

Serialization: JSON, Protocol Buffers, or custom binary.

Video Stream Channel (UDP/RTP or WebRTC): For low-latency video transmission.

RTSP could be used for stream negotiation if using standard streaming servers/clients.

WebRTC data channels could also handle video if you want browser-based P2P.

Custom UDP protocol if you want full control (requires handling packet loss, reordering).

Discovery (Optional but Recommended): mDNS/Bonjour (e.g., zeroconf library) for clients to find the server or vice-versa.

II. Streamlit UI (on Central Laptop):

Displays:

List of connected source laptops (clients) with status indicators (online, streaming, active).

Thumbnails or small previews of each video stream (if feasible performance-wise).

The main, larger video feed from the currently active source laptop.

Controls:

Buttons/list items to select which source laptop is active (i.e., receives K/M input and has its video prominently displayed).

Start/Stop server functionality.

Basic configuration (e.g., server IP/port if not using discovery).

Connection logs/status messages.

Implementation Notes:

Streamlit will interact with the Central Control Hub's backend logic.

Video display:

Could use st.image() and update it rapidly.

For better performance, might need to embed an HTML5 video player (<video>) or a custom component if using WebRTC, or an OpenCV window managed separately from Streamlit but triggered by it.

Asynchronous updates will be crucial for a responsive UI while handling network I/O.

III. "Whatnot" (Beyond Video, Keyboard, Mouse):

Shared Clipboard:

Central Hub intercepts clipboard changes locally, sends to active client.

Active client intercepts clipboard changes, sends to Central Hub.

File Transfer (Ambitious):

UI option to drag-and-drop or select files to send to the active client.

Requires a separate data transfer protocol or using existing methods over the control channel.

Audio Streaming (Ambitious):

Capture audio output from source laptops and stream to central.

Capture audio input from central laptop (mic) and stream to active source.

IV. Technical Stack Suggestions (Python-centric):

Central Hub & Client Core Logic: Python

Networking: socket, asyncio (for non-blocking I/O), zeroconf (for discovery).

Screen Capture (Client): mss (fast, cross-platform), Pillow (ImageGrab).

Video Encoding/Decoding:

OpenCV-python (cv2) with its VideoWriter (needs ffmpeg backend) and VideoCapture.

Direct ffmpeg-python bindings.

Python bindings for GStreamer (PyGObject).

Keyboard/Mouse Control:

Capture (Central): pynput.

Injection (Client): pynput, pyautogui.

UI: streamlit.

Serialization: json, protobuf.

Testing: pytest, unittest.mock.

V. Comprehensive Unittesting Strategy:

Isolate Components: Mock dependencies heavily.

Network Module:

Test message serialization/deserialization.

Test connection establishment/teardown logic (mocking actual sockets).

Test handling of different message types.

Test error conditions (connection refused, timeouts).

Input Manager (Central):

Mock pynput listeners. Simulate events and verify they are captured and formatted correctly.

Input Injector (Client):

Mock pynput controllers or pyautogui. Verify that received event data translates to the correct mocked OS calls.

Screen Capturer (Client):

Mock mss or Pillow. Verify it's called correctly. Test (if possible) with dummy image data generation.

Video Encoder/Decoder:

Mock cv2 or ffmpeg. Test with small, known image/frame data. Verify encoding parameters are set. Verify decoding produces expected (mocked) output.

State Manager (Central):

Test adding/removing clients.

Test switching active client logic.

Test state transitions and notifications.

Streamlit UI (Interaction Logic):

Test callback functions.

Mock the backend service the UI calls. Verify UI actions trigger correct backend calls.

Verify UI updates correctly based on (mocked) backend state changes. (Harder, may need streamlit-testing-library or similar if it matures).

Discovery Module:

Mock zeroconf interactions. Test service registration and discovery logic.

Test Cases - Examples:

test_server_handles_new_client_connection()

test_server_forwards_keyboard_event_to_active_client()

test_server_rejects_mouse_event_if_no_active_client()

test_client_sends_video_frame_upon_capture()

test_client_injects_received_mouse_move_event()

test_protocol_message_serialization_and_deserialization()

test_ui_updates_client_list_on_new_connection_event()

test_ui_switch_button_calls_server_set_active_client()

test_graceful_shutdown_client_disconnect()

test_video_stream_reconnection_logic()

Fixtures (pytest):

Create fixtures for mock server instances, mock client instances, sample network messages, dummy image frames.

Coverage: Aim for high code coverage, especially for core logic.

VII. Key Decisions & Challenges:

Video Streaming Performance: This is the hardest part.

Latency: How real-time does it need to be?

Bandwidth: H.264 is good, but encoding takes CPU. Raw frames are too big.

CPU Usage: Screen capture + encoding on clients, decoding + display on server.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: pynput, mss help, but OS-specifics for K/M injection and screen capture can be tricky (e.g., Wayland on Linux).

Security:

Currently unencrypted. For sensitive environments, TLS/SSL for control and SRTP/DTLS for video would be needed.

Authentication/authorization of clients.

Error Handling & Resilience: Network drops, client crashes, etc.

UI Responsiveness: Streamlit needs to run the server backend in a separate thread or process to not block UI interactions. asyncio in the backend helps.

VIII. Phased Development Approach:

Phase 1 (Core K/M):

Basic server & client networking (TCP).

Keyboard/mouse capture on server, transmission, and injection on client.

No video, minimal UI (maybe command-line to switch).

Unittests for K/M and networking.

Phase 2 (Basic Video):

Client screen capture and streaming (e.g., MJPEG or simple frame-by-frame).

Server receives and displays one stream (e.g., in an OpenCV window).

Unittests for capture and basic streaming.

Phase 3 (Streamlit UI & Multi-Client Video):

Develop Streamlit UI for client selection and displaying the active video.

Server handles multiple video streams (decoding the active one, maybe thumbnails for others).

Unittests for UI interactions (mocked backend).

Phase 4 (Refinements & "Whatnot"):

Improve video encoding (H.264).

Add discovery (mDNS).

Add shared clipboard.

Performance optimization.

More robust error handling.

Phase 5 (Advanced Features - Optional):

File transfer, audio.

Security enhancements.

This detailed breakdown should give you a solid foundation to start designing and implementing your custom KVM project. Good luck!
